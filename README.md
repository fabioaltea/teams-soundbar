## ðŸ“– Description

**MIDI4Meeting** is an application that allows users to play sounds directly into a **Microsoft Teams meeting** through a bot powered by **Recall.ai**, all from a clean and responsive interface.  

The solution is built with a **React + TypeScript frontend (bundled with Vite)** and a **Node.js + Express + TypeScript backend** connected to a **PostgreSQL database**. Both the frontend and backend are hosted on **Vercel**.  

An **SPFx (SharePoint Framework) app** embeds the frontend inside Teams, enabling users to access the application seamlessly within the meeting environment.  

The stack also integrates **Recall.ai** for real-time bot functionality within meetings.
